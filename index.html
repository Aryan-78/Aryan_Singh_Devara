								<u><h3>Turtle Race Master</h3></u>
								Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp;
								<span class="button small">Object-Oriented Programming</span> &nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Fuzzy Logic</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Algorithm</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Creating a turtle race simulator from scratch which uses fuzzy inputs so that max membership function turtle wins, where else it also shows the crisp output. It helps us to understand the importance of a fuzzy system in the real world. Its main challenge of doing that project was not to use the fuzzy module in python
								</p>
								Output <br><br>
								<pre><code>Would you like to play again Yes

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 1

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 2

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 5

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 3

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 8

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 1

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 2

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 6


The actual crisp value for the given fuzzy set: 
4.448


The winner is:

							<u><h3>Sudoku Solving Algorithm</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Algorithm</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Data Structure</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/7.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I have created two algorithms to solve a Sudoku in which one uses a Backtracking algorithm where else another code doesn't use a backtracking algorithm.

							<u><h3>Voice Assistant</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Operating System</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Audio Processing</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It was a project in which the system interacts with the user on an audio basis and helps the user to do the task. It is the enhanced version of other relatable assistants as here we even have access to the operating system

							<u><h3>Event Site</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Django</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Bootstrap</span>&nbsp;
								<span class="button small">Object-Relational Mapping</span>&nbsp;
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/5.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I have created an Event site using bootstrap and give it a server using Django local server.

							<u><h3>Face Mask</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Computer Vision</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Video Processing</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/snip1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It was a project in which I learn and understand how to use computer vision so that we create landmarks on the face through which we can do many interesting things.
							</p><p>	We use shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat for our project which has been trained by ibug database which is over 5000 over database images so that's why it is very accurate and fast.

							<u><h3>Drowsy Detection</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Computer Vision</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Video Processing</span>
								<span class="button small">Algorithm</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/snip2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/snip3.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this Project, we moved one step ahead of the Face Mask and created a drowsy detection system. With the help of the landmarks on the eyes, we created and find the value of the eye aspect ratio. which help us to find that whether the person is sleepy or not

							<u><h3>Fire alarm mechanism</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">PCB Design</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Op-Amp Operation</span>&nbsp; <br>
							<p>We learn how to use an op-amp, and with the help of a thermister we could actually generate a fire alarm mechanism which detects heat</p>
							<hr />
							<u><h3>Street light timing mechanism</h3></u>
							Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">8051 Programming</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Algorithm</span>&nbsp; <br>
							<p>We learn how to use an 8051 programming chip to create a timing mechanism which can be used for street lights</p>

								<h2 class="major">Workshop</h2>
								<u><h3>Quadrator</h3></u>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cer1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>It was a two-day workshop in which on the first day we learn the physics of the copter like how the wings lift the plane, Thrust, Drag, Lift, Payload, Roll Motion, YawnMotion, Pitch Motion.</p>
								<p>On the second day, we created our own quadra-copter using KK2.1.5 flight microcontroller and even assign a PID system to the copter and at the end, we fly it in the ground.</p>

								<u><h3>Bluetooth, voice control car</h3></u>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/6.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>It was a two-day workshop in which on the first day we learn the basics of Arduino and how it works</p>
								<p>On the second day, we coded the Arduino and connect all the circuit and with the help of Arduino Bluetooth Control we creted the Bluetoot and voice control car</p>

								<p>I was part of the internship provided by the Analytics Domain and The main thing that I learn through it was how to learn new skills on our own.</p>
								<p>As part of the internship, I was assigned multiple tasks, Such as I have created an eCommerce site for the customer, I have tested some of the sites as well, but The most promising thing that l have done is to create a full-stack website that can be used as an API and as an essay analyzer as well (which is similar to the PTE).</p>
